# PCG-Angry-Bots

A singleplayer game that determines the player's map preferences based on ratings that the player leaves on each map that they play. Created in Unity Game Engine. This game was utilized as a test bed for a PhD experiment and was never intended to be commercialized.

Live game is available to play at http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~wraffe/ExperimentDownload.shtml . Note that the data collection phase of this experiment has concluded.

All assets that are preceded by "PCG" were created by William Raffe. All other assets are part of the "Angry Bots" tech demo, created by the Unity develeopment team and made freely available online at https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12175 .
